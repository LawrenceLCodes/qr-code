## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 with variables for colours
- Flexbox
- Media query for mobile viewports up to 375px

### What I learned

This was a relatively straightforward HTML and CSS component. The major challenges were finding a feasible solution to preventing the QR code image from expanding outside its parent container. Using a width of 100% on the img class. Finally, it was important that I constrain the size of the entire qr component so that it was not oversized for desktop and tablet viewports.

### Continued development

Some ideas for continued development include making the qr code "clickable" or selectable using a mouse or touch screen tap.

### Useful resources

- [Fitting a CSS Image Into A Container](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/72487-how-to-get-a-css-image-to-fit-in-a-container-like-fit-to-size#:~:text=To%20get%20a%20CSS%20image%20to%20fit%20into%20a%20container,if%20the%20container%20size%20changes.) - The suggestions on this webpage provided me with ideas on how to progress. It was useful in overcoming the roadblock of constraining the image to fit in its container at all viewports. I have added this resource to my personal knowledge management for future reference.
